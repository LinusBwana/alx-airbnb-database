## Summary of Normalization Analysis
I've analyzed the AirBnB database schema and identified several normalization violations that I've corrected to achieve **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:

**Key Issues Found:**

- **Location Field Violation (1NF)**: The original `properties.location` field like "New York, NY" wasn't atomic
- **Data Redundancy**: Same location strings repeated across multiple properties
- **Calculated Field Dependency**: `total_price` in bookings could become inconsistent
- **Missing Business Rules**: Reviews weren't tied to actual bookings

**Normalization Solutions Applied:**

- **Created `locations` table** - Eliminates location redundancy and makes fields atomic
- **Removed calculated `total_price`** - Now calculated on-demand via views
- **Enhanced `reviews` table** - Now references bookings to ensure reviewers actually stayed
- **Added helpful views** - For common queries that need calculated fields
- **Added business constraints** - Like preventing self-messaging and ensuring valid date ranges

**Benefits of the Normalized Design:**

1. **Data Integrity:** No duplicate location data, reviews tied to real bookings
2. **Consistency:** Location updates happen in one place
3. **Scalability:** Easy to add location attributes (postal codes, coordinates, etc.)
4. **Performance:** Better indexing and more efficient queries
5. **Maintenance:** Cleaner separation of concerns

The new schema is fully compliant with 3NF while maintaining all the original functionality. The views provide convenient access to commonly needed calculated fields without storing redundant data.
