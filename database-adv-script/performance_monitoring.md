# Database Performance Monitoring and Refinement

## Objective
Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and making schema adjustments.

---

## Step 1: Monitor Queries
Use SQL commands like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` or `SHOW PROFILE` (depending on the database engine) to analyze the performance of frequently used queries.

### Example 1: Monitoring a JOIN query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, p.name AS property_name
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE u.email = 'john@example.com';
```
This reveals the execution plan, estimated costs, and whether indexes are being used.

### Example 2: Monitoring a Property Search Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, p.price_per_night, p.location
FROM properties p
WHERE p.location = 'New York'
  AND p.availability = TRUE
  AND p.price_per_night BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY p.price_per_night ASC;
```

### Example 3: Monitoring User Booking History
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, p.name, b.total_cost
FROM bookings b
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.user_id = 12345
  AND b.start_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

---

## Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks
From profiling and analysis:

- **Full table scans** on `users.email` indicate the need for an index.
- **Sorting operations** without indexes lead to high cost in `ORDER BY` queries.
- **Frequent joins** on `bookings.user_id` and `bookings.property_id` are expensive without indexes.
- **Location-based searches** on `properties.location` require indexing for performance.
- **Date range queries** on `bookings.start_date` are slow without proper indexing.

### Common Performance Issues Found:
1. Sequential scans on large tables
2. Hash joins instead of nested loop joins
3. External sorting (using disk instead of memory)
4. Missing indexes on foreign key columns
5. Inefficient WHERE clause filtering

---

## Step 3: Suggested Improvements

### Indexes
```sql
-- Primary indexes for frequent lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_location_price ON properties(location, price_per_night);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_availability_location ON properties(availability, location);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_date ON bookings(user_id, start_date);

-- Date-based indexes for time-series queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_start_date ON bookings(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_date_range ON bookings(start_date, end_date);
```
These reduce full table scans.

### Schema Adjustments
1. **Partition large tables** (e.g., `bookings`) by `start_date` for faster date-range queries:
```sql
-- Create partitioned bookings table
CREATE TABLE bookings_partitioned (
    booking_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    property_id INTEGER,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    total_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (start_date);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE bookings_2024_01 PARTITION OF bookings_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE bookings_2024_02 PARTITION OF bookings_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
```

2. **Normalize or denormalize** tables depending on read/write patterns:
```sql
-- Denormalized property search table for faster lookups
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW property_search_view AS
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    p.availability,
    p.property_type,
    u.first_name AS host_name,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating,
    COUNT(r.review_id) AS review_count
FROM properties p
JOIN users u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.price_per_night, 
         p.availability, p.property_type, u.first_name;

CREATE INDEX idx_property_search_location ON property_search_view(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_search_price ON property_search_view(price_per_night);
```

### Query Optimization
1. **Remove unnecessary joins:**
```sql
-- Before: Unnecessary join
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'john@example.com';

-- After: Direct query
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM users
WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
```

2. **Use EXISTS instead of IN** for correlated subqueries where applicable:
```sql
-- Before: Using IN
SELECT p.property_id, p.name
FROM properties p
WHERE p.property_id IN (
    SELECT b.property_id 
    FROM bookings b 
    WHERE b.start_date > '2024-01-01'
);

-- After: Using EXISTS
SELECT p.property_id, p.name
FROM properties p
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM bookings b 
    WHERE b.property_id = p.property_id 
      AND b.start_date > '2024-01-01'
);
```

3. **Use LIMIT** where only a subset of data is needed:
```sql
-- Add LIMIT to paginated queries
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, p.price_per_night
FROM properties p
WHERE p.location = 'New York'
ORDER BY p.price_per_night ASC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;
```
